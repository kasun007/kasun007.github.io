Trust is crucial in the workplace as it involves relying on someone else to act with integrity and do what's right. When trust is lacking, it can lead to conflicts, which can cost a company a considerable amount of time and money. According to a CPP Inc report, employees in the U.S. spend around 2.1 hours per week resolving conflicts, which costs companies approximately $359 billion in paid hours. Moreover, a toxic work environment with no trust can cause stress, burnout, and reduced motivation among employees.
On the other hand, a high-trust environment promotes collaboration and creativity as everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. It eventually results in better organizational performance. Building trust among team members is a vital aspect of leadership. As a leader, you can follow these tips to establish trust within your team and understand how to achieve it.


### 1. Empower your employees

There are some leaders who fear losing control of their team's work and tend to micromanage and excessively supervise their employees. Such behavior can create a negative perception among the employees, who may perceive their leader as lacking trust and confidence in them. On the other hand, when leaders allow their team members to act independently and empower them, it fosters a sense of accountability and instills a feeling of value and trust from their leader. This not only builds trust but also boosts employees' commitment to their work responsibilities and enhances their performance as they gain greater control over their work.

### 2. Build personal connections


To foster trust and reliance among team members, it's important to establish personal connections. When employees don't feel comfortable or close with their colleagues, it can hinder their ability to work together effectively. Organizing social events outside of work hours can help break down barriers and encourage team bonding. These gatherings could involve sharing personal stories, participating in hobbies, discussing cultural interests, or engaging in team-building exercises.


### 3. Avoid playing the blame game
Mistakes are common in any workplace, regardless of the level of expertise. However, it can create a negative atmosphere when team members begin to point fingers and blame each other. This not only fosters fear and distrust among team members but can also damage morale and productivity. Instead of blaming, creating a culture that embraces constructive criticism and support can enhance collaboration and trust within the team.

### 4 Prioritize the well-being of employees
Trust is established on emotions, and one way to foster trust is by demonstrating empathy towards your employees and prioritizing their well-being during both good and bad times. During the Covid-19 pandemic, some business leaders made employee protection and welfare a top priority despite the challenging circumstances. When employees know that their leaders genuinely care and support them, they develop a sense of trust towards their leaders.

### 5 Practice transparency
When you share information such as work schedules, progress, and status, team members are less likely to feel surprised or upset if something goes wrong, reducing the likelihood of them thinking you are an unreliable team member. Furthermore, being open about your own shortcomings, such as admitting when you do not know the answer or have made a mistake, establishes that you are a trustworthy person, regardless of your current capabilities or knowledge.

Building trust takes time and effort, and it requires both leadership and team members to commit genuinely to each other. One way to begin is by gathering feedback from employees to assess the team culture, identifying whether a high-trust or low-trust team culture exists and implementing the above tips accordingly to address specific gaps.
